electric cars are poised for a boom, spurred by factors such as federal policy, technological advances and environmental concerns.To that point, 41% of Americans are at least somewhat likely to buy an electric vehicle as their next car, according to a recent poll from the University of Chicago and The Associated Press.Yet, many consumers view high cost as a deterrent — 60% cited it as a ""major reason"" they wouldn\'t purchase an electric vehicle, or EV.More From Personal Finance:3 ways to cut costs on \'off the charts\' travel expensesHere are 2 alternatives to the $7,500 EV tax creditMore retirement plans will soon have annuity optionsMost new EVs are luxury models with an average sale price of more than $61,000 — roughly $12,000 more than the auto industry average, according to Consumer Reports.But upfront cost doesn\'t tell the whole story.In many cases, electric vehicles can be a better financial deal for buyers over the long haul relative to their gasoline-only counterparts, after accounting for recurring costs such as maintenance, repair and fuel, i.e., gasoline or electricity.Those costs tend to be lower for EVs and may therefore outweigh an initially higher sticker price over a multiyear ownership period, experts said.EVs might save you $6,000 or more, but \'it depends\'Adamkaz | E+ | Getty ImagesThe typical EV owner saves $6,000 to $10,000 over the life of most such vehicles compared with a gasoline-only model, according to a Consumer Reports study from 2020. The study compared vehicles of similar size and segment — luxury, for example — and defined a car\'s life as 200,000 miles.Since that study was published, many EVs have gotten cheaper and conventional vehicles more expensive, said Chris Harto, senior transportation and energy policy analyst at Consumer Reports.The Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in August, extended a federal tax credit for new EVs through 2032. That tax incentive — which is worth up to $7,500 and carries some qualification restrictions — aims to make EVs more affordable.When comparing similar cars on total cost during ownership, ""battery electric vehicles tend to come out ahead of [internal combustion engine] vehicles, on average,"" said Debapriya Chakraborty, an economist and assistant professional researcher at the Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California, Davis.However, there are many caveats that could change that outcome for an individual buyer, she said.These include regional electricity and gasoline prices; the availability of home vs. public charging, the latter of which is typically more expensive; and the range of the electric vehicle.""Yes, EVs are [generally] a better deal, if you include all the [financial] incentives you could potentially get and primarily charge at home,"" said Maxwell Woody, a research assistant at the University of Michigan\'s Center for Sustainable Systems.But there are many variables that could change the calculus, he added.Consumers can use various online calculators, such as one from the U.S. Energy Department or the UC Davis Electric Vehicle Research Center, to estimate their total EV ownership costs and carbon emissions based on various car models and travel habits.How regional factors can affect total EV costWitthaya Prasongsin | Moment | Getty ImagesTo illustrate the caveats, Woody — who is conducting a study of regional lifecycle costs of gasoline versus electric vehicles — offered an example of hypothetical car buyers in Chicago and Houston.He compared the total lifetime cost in each city for a small electric sport utility vehicle with a 300-mile range and a $48,000 suggested retail price to that of a small gas-powered SUV with a $31,000 price tag.In Chicago, an average buyer would come out ahead with the electric over 15 years. They would pay about $84,000 total, versus $87,000 for the gas car, Woody said.In Houston, the opposite is true: An average buyer would pay about $82,000 for the gas vehicle and $85,000 for the EV over the same time period.Here\'s why: Buyers in Chicago can get an extra $4,000 incentive from the state, making EVs less expensive at the time of purchase, Woody said. Chicago also has relatively inexpensive electricity, so the EV is also much less costly to operate, he added.On the other hand, Houston has among the lowest gas prices in the country, reducing the overall fuel-cost savings reaped from an EV when compared with a traditional car. Texas also doesn\'t offer an additional tax incentive to EV buyers.The analysis accounts for cooler weather in Chicago, which generally makes EVs less efficient, Woody said.Cost savings aren\'t the only factor driving EV salesA charging station for electric and hybrid cars using solar panels to generate electricity.Artur Debat | Moment | Getty ImagesEV sales accounted for 5.8% of the nearly 14 million new cars sold in the U.S. last year, according to Kelley Blue Book data. That was up from 3.1% the year before.Globally, about 13% of new cars sold in 2022 were electric, and EVs are ""surging in popularity,"" according to the International Energy Agency. \xa0Potential lifecycle cost savings isn\'t the only factor driving purchases, though.Thirty-five percent of Americans say reducing their personal impact on climate change is a major reason they would buy an electric car — the No. 2 reason behind saving money on gasoline, at 46%, according to the University of Chicago-Associated Press poll.There are several types of EVs: for example, all-electric vehicles, which run only on battery power, and plug-in hybrid electrics, which have both battery and gasoline engines.There are direct-to-consumer savings, and broader societal benefits, to purchasing an EV.Ingrid Malmgrenpolicy director of Plug In AmericaSince they don\'t burn fossil fuels, fully electric cars don\'t emit planet-warming greenhouse gases from their tailpipes.Some emissions are created when electric cars are built and charged, if the electricity comes from dirtier sources such as burning coal instead of clean sources such as wind and solar. However, electric cars have a much lower overall climate impact even when factoring in those life-cycle emissions, according to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.""Electric vehicles are the key technology to decarbonize road transport,"" the International Energy Agency said.Just 1.6 million of the 270 million passenger cars and trucks on U.S. roads are electric — amounting to less than 1% of all vehicles, according to the World Economic Forum.burwellphotography | E+ | Getty ImagesThe Biden administration on April 12 proposed auto emissions rules expected to dramatically boost EV sales. The rules set more stringent pollution standards for cars and trucks, which would essentially force the auto industry to sell many more EVs to meet the requirements. The White House estimates as many as 67% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. will be electric by 2032.The standards come as the world\'s top climate scientists said in a March report that a major course correction is needed to avert the worst impacts of climate change, such as more severe floods, droughts and wildfires.Transportation is the largest annual source of greenhouse gas pollution in the U.S., accounting for 28% of total national emissions in 2021, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. \xa0""There are direct-to-consumer savings, and broader societal benefits, to purchasing an EV,"" said Ingrid Malmgren, policy director of Plug In America.Why battery and range matter for buyersBattery size, which influences the range of an EV, can make a big difference in ownership cost, since the battery is generally the most expensive part of the car, said Woody of the University of Michigan. More range typically means a higher price tag.Today, EVs with a roughly 200-mile range generally have a sticker price comparable to or lower than a gasoline-powered car, even without tax incentives or other lifetime savings, Woody said.Consumers who buy an EV with a 300-mile range may need a federal tax break to achieve sticker-price parity with gas-only cars, while those with a 400-mile range are generally still more expensive upfront even with tax incentives, Woody said.To that point, an all-electric vehicle with a range of 200 miles has among the lowest lifecycle ownership costs of all types of passenger vehicles, according to a 2021 report issued by Argonne, a U.S. Department of Energy laboratory.Such a vehicle costs consumers 45.3 cents per mile over a 15-year ownership period, beaten out only by hybrid electric vehicles, according to Argonne. That compares with 48 cents per mile for gasoline-only cars. However, a 300-mile-range all-electric vehicle ranked last, at 51.8 cents per mile, due to relatively high battery costs. \xa0Koiguo | Moment | Getty ImagesThe report accounts for factors including maintenance, repair, taxes, fees and insurance. It doesn\'t account for tax incentives, however.Total ownership costs for all-electric vehicles are expected to keep dropping as battery technology improves and to be broadly cost-competitive with other car models in about five years, Argonne said. \xa0Many automakers, including Tesla and Ford, dropped prices on their EVs in 2023. And current price trends signal that EVs with a $25,000 sticker price aren\'t far off.The price of the average new car rose almost 5% in 2022 to $49,507, while the price of the average EV fell 0.6% to $61,448 — which is high but now lower than the average luxury car, according to Kelley Blue Book.Fuel and maintenance costsSwitching to an all-electric vehicle would yield average fuel savings of 55% for consumers nationwide, according to a University of Michigan study published in January.More than 90% of households would also reduce the greenhouse gases they generate, the study found.The largest cost reductions would occur in the South and West, the study said. A small share of households, 0.1%, in Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan and Rhode Island, would see their energy costs rise by switching to an all-electric car.Fuel cost reductions brought by the adoption of all-electric cars ""are significant enough that more than double the American households (i.e. over 80%) would have low [transportation] energy burdens,"" relative to 33% today, the report said. Lower-income households wouldn\'t benefit as much as those with higher incomes, it found.Frederic J. Brown | Afp | Getty ImagesResidential charging is more cost-effective than public charging, the study found. Such a dynamic may reduce savings and convenience for renters who can\'t install a charging station at home, for example, said Chakraborty of the University of California.Electric cars also have fewer moving parts, meaning they generally require less maintenance, said Malmgren of Plug In America. EVs often come with longer warranty periods than gas-powered cars; by law they must carry eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty periods, with more consumer-friendly rules in California, she said.""There are fewer things to break,"" Malmgren said. ""You\'re not replacing brake pads, transmissions, belts, hoses, fluids.""""They\'re just way easier to maintain,"" she said.Between fuel and maintenance, the average electric SUV owner saves $1,700 a year in fuel and maintenance costs, according to Harto of Consumer Reports. That assumes a $3.50 per gallon gasoline price, a rough ballpark of current prices, he said.']",,,,
,"Electric cars are cool but they have some serious deficiencies. 1. They are too expensive, 2. They can't go far enough, 3. They take too long to charge, 4. You can't carry spare fuel. 5. They are no good for towing, 6. If you replace all gasoline cars with electric you will make almost no difference to CO2 emissions, not enough to matter.
They do have lots of torque but if you use it your battery will be drained in a very short time.

,"I have a little insight here owning both a decent electric and gas powered car, while living in scandinavia aka cold area ( [https://imgur.com/a/PtBectY](https://imgur.com/a/PtBectY) ).
Our electric car is actually the cheaper car of the two, yet it came with WAY more equipment than our gas car did. In fact I would have to spit out another €4500 in the gas car to match the equipment in the electric car.
Not only was the electric car the cheaper car to buy, it is also by far the cheaper car to drive. We have a monthly subscription that gives us unlimited charging for €100 a month, including our home charger (and is completely free the first year). For reference, that is only slightly more than a tank of gas in the gas powered car costs, and that only lasts me about a week. So at the bare minimum, our electric car is 4x as cheap to operate for me. I plug it in every day when I come home and always have a full battery. 
I only have to worry about charging times on long trips, and even then I rarely stop for more than 15 minutes at a time. I do multiple 700 km trips every month without being bothered by the distance of the car even the slightest.",,,
,"I would have to assume your government heavily subsidises the purchase and operating of your EV? Do they have a road user charge so you are paying your fair share of infrastructure costs? The majority of the cost of petrol where I live is tax and that supports  a whole lot of government expenditure. EV users are dodging this tax as well as using subsidies so the true cost of the vehicle is borne by taxpayers.

,"We have extremely high car taxes, up to 180% of the original price of the car. This is slightly lower for EV’s, because part of this tax is based on CO2 emissions. We don’t get any bonus or anything like that for buying an EV. EV owners actually pay more road tax anually, because this is based on size and weight of the vehicle, naturally EV’s are heavier. We don’t rely on fuel tax much. 
We have an excessive amount of wind power here, so the electricity market is very competitive. Again no bonus or anything from the government here.",,,

I don't think you can apply the notion of ""energy efficiency"" to fuel production. You're producing energy, not using it. ^1 Sure, some of the production steps use energy, but that just deducts from the total production. When you power the harvester with your own grain alcohol, you're still producing more than you use.
Now it's possible that you would produce more energy per acre (i.e. area-efficiency) by just putting up photovoltaic panels instead of planting grain. Maybe. Maybe that would also be cheaper to operate in the long run. But that's beside the point.

,"Electric cars aren’t all spiffy shiny like people think. I hear a lot of “Buy electric and save the environment.”
Keep in mind that most of the car is plastic. This is made of petroleum. The materials for the batteries are made from tons of mining. They’re transported by diesel trucks to dealerships. A lot of the advanced components have the same issues with “dirty” parts of their manufacturing. It’s kind of like how ethanol was added to gas to theoretically improve emissions, but they found that all the emissions released in the manufacturing, processing, and distribution counteracted the benefit of having it in the fuel.
You’re going to have a similar issue when all the parts and instillation of the charging stations and other necessary infrastructure go in. More petroleum will be used for coating cables, whose internal wires will be mined and smelted. Same for the pipes they’re mounted on. All that is gonna be moved and the installed by workers in diesel trucks.
Then there is charging. Lots of that clean electricity comes from coal power plants. Even if you say it doesn’t, the potential fallout from one nuclear meltdown out weighs all the emissions from fossil fuel put together. Even hydro electric has issues from an environmental standpoint. There are rivers now that are removing them to help repair their local ecology. Solar and wind also have issues with dirty manufacturing as well as just not being capable of producing enough power currently.
Then there is the issue that almost all of them try to be proprietary and make components you can only get serviced and repaired at a dealer, F-info with the economy. California is trying to legally force people to go electric. In effect binding them to the mercy of the dealers. Unless they pass legislation forcing manufacturers to allow right to repair, I don’t think it’s feasible.

,"So your biggest issue with electric cars is the styling? I get it, good old American muscle cars are absolutely beautiful, but in all reality... they're junk. They're poorly built, they're underpowered (power-to-weight ratio is hilarious), they chug gasoline, they're dangerous, and mechanically inferior in every way. Take that sexy-ass 1969 Mach 1 for example. Upwards to 250hp factory - a 2020 Fusion has up to 245hp factory and a much better power-to-weight ratio. The *only* thing that Mustang is good for is looking pretty.
And don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the sound and raw power of an unbridled V8, but as a car enthusiast and automotive professional of 15+ years, performance is where the fun is.

As for replacing them - I don't see any downsides to it. They perform better, you can take any gas car and convert it to electric, better for the environment, performance (again).

,"You do realize that the electricity that charges your electric vehicle mostly comes from fossil fuel power plants. So until we have a green grid, electric cars are the equivalent of stopping dirty manufacturing in the country by shipping the pollution of industry to less developed countries...
Also, fleet vehicles, planes, etc  are responsible for the majority of emissions so our major focus on electric vehicles should be for commercial ones, not individual ones. Trying to put all problems on to the consumers is no different then the corporations who contribute 70% of the pollution in the world asking people to use LED bulbs and recycle.",,,
,"Yeah but that same fuel is utilized one heck of a lot more efficiently. Also, majority of our emissions actually comes from livestock, not engines, therefore nullifying this whole conversation if that's the route you want to go. Small changes on the scale of all consumers makes a big difference, so yes, it's a drop in the bucket I'm the grand scheme of things but it sure is better than doing nothing just because it's not a perfect solution yet.",,,
,"I wasn't talking about emissions as a whole, just the ones from the transportation sector. Approximately 25% of total emissions come from the transportation sector. Around 80% of that is from fleet and commercial vehicles. Let the largest polluters be the ones to pay for the infrastructure instead of dumping the bill on tax payers. That's why I believe we need to start from the top down instead of dumping all the responsibility on the consumer. Once industry has a robust infrastructure that supports nationwide distribution of charging technology, then it's easy to get consumers to switch. Corporations should make it easy for consumers to enter the EV market instead of the other way around.",,,
,"I mean .. that's already happening. There is a decent number of companies that have developed electric truck companies that are slowly but surely infiltrating the market, all the while developing the infrastructure for charging stations.

,"Electric cars green with the grid every time a solar panel gets installed or a ff plant gets shut down the car runs a little greener, gas cars will never be any better for the environment then the day they roll off the lot. Plus even if electric cars are powered from fossil fuel plants, they get more miles out of the fuel. Power plants are way more efficient than cars and that efficiency gets transferred to the car, which can use every drop of power without much waste thanks to regenerative breaking. My car gets 135empg. So for every gallon of gas that’s efficiently converted to electricity, my car can drive 135 miles. 
There is also that you move the burning of the fossil fuels away from populations and reduce air pollution from where people are breathing it, which is a benefit.",,,
," But those things aren't happening yet in most places, so it's still fossil fuels powering them. That fuel is still transported by diesel trucks, trains, and ships that eat fuel at thousands of tonnes a day. This is one of the two issues I have with pushing consumers to go green while they just hide the pollution so you don't see it. People driving cars is a small fraction of vehicle emissions in the world. Commercial vehicles are responsible for the majority. This needs to be a top down conversion, not bottom up. Fleet vehicles need to be first. Then you have someone to help pay for the infrastructure. I don't agree with tax payers footing the entire bill when the multinational corporations are responsible for 70% of the worlds emissions. I'm tired of them fucking up the world and then trying to guilt you and me into believing it's our fault. I have solar panels on my roof, and heat pump hot water heater, led bulbs in everything, and keep the AC on 80 and heat on 68. I do all that and it doesn't change shit in the world. If the airline and shipping industry did their part, air quality would be dramatically changed in months. I mean look how quick the air cleared up when the world locked down last year. The earth can heal itself pretty quickly when we give it a chance.
As to your second point, moving pollution from one place to another does not get rid of it. The earth is a gigantic singular ecosystem. Moving emissions from one place to another is like taking the trash out of your trash can and putting it in a closet. You're still trashing your house, even if you can't see it. 
I'm all for electric cars, but I will still keep something with an internal combustion engine, even if it has to be some hybrid fuel. I don't want to destroy old cars and their history. But I also understand that it is exactly that, history. I look forward to the future of EV's.",,,

,"Agreed, they're not the same. But whether that's worse or better seems to be a matter of perspective. You don't need to be deafened by an engine to enjoy the driving experience.
I too was a manual-only (""stick shift"") driver, because I generally hated when auto transmissions decided to change gears. EVs don't have gear changes, so losing the stick didn't worry me. (This technically doesn't apply to all EVs, but it does to mine).
As for filling your car up in 1 minute (seems optimistic, but whatever) - how about never having to do it at all? That's the best way to own an EV: charge at home when you're not using it. No driving to the station, no queues, no waiting. And a fraction of the cost.
Oil and gas do make *some* people rich - but at the expense of literally everyone else. That probably includes you.",,,

,"TLDR of my other comment. Start from the top with fleets and commercial vehicles so that the corporations and industry that due the most damage to the environment are the ones who have to invest in the infrastructure instead of dumping it on tax payers and consumers to clean up their mess. Highways will never be electrified entirely, to where you charge while you drive, until tractor trailers are electric. They won't spend that money for a few people with Teslas. Once the infrastructure becomes more readily available, then you push the public to convert. Beyond the infrastructure, some of those large companies also have alot more money for R&D than auto manufacturers, which would help the tech advance for more efficiency, better batteries, etc. Corporations are great at squeezing out every last penny for efficiency and cost, so let's use it to our advantage for a change.",,,

There are plenty of climate and air quality reasons to buy an electric vehicle (EV), but is it cheaper to drive? While this is a complicated question that has befuddled car shoppers for years, in most cases, an EV will indeed be cheaper in the long run. And with automakers slashing prices for EVs in the past year on top of federal incentives for eligible buyers, you may even be able to score a bargain up front. Let’s sort out the details. Sticker prices for electric vs. gas cars According to data from Cox Automotive (parent company of Kelley Blue Book), the average price paid for a new EV has fallen significantly—in September 2023, it came down by $14,300 over the prior year. This amounted to a cost of just $2,800 more than the average paid for a new gas-powered vehicle. And with the EV market growing rapidly, the price margin is expected to shrink even more in the coming years as manufacturers produce more affordable models and improve battery technology, the most expensive part of an EV. You can mitigate some of that cost by making use of tax incentives, which can shave thousands off an EV’s price tag. The federal EV tax credit offers up to $7,500 for new EVs and, for the first time, $4,000 for used EVs, too, for eligible buyers and EVs. In addition, new rules from U.S. Department of the Treasury will soon allow participating auto dealers to provide the tax credit directly to consumers at the point of sale, making savings more immediate. One asterisk: Automakers must now meet new EV manufacturing requirements in order for their vehicles to qualify for those federal incentives, which will likely temporarily impact the availability of eligible EVs while supply chains catch up. Many states offer their own tax incentives, too, so take the time to search for what’s available for the model you’re interested in buying. Be sure to also consider adding an EV charger to your home. Charging from a standard 120-volt outlet for eight hours overnight will add about 32 miles of range, which is typically plenty for daily driving needs. If you want to charge faster to be able to make frequent and/or longer trips, installing a Level 2, 240-volt outlet and charger in your garage can allow you to add more than 250 miles overnight. That installation will typically cost you about $2,000, but some states and local utility companies offer incentives to offset it, as does the Inflation Reduction Act. Once you have an idea of what incentives you qualify for, you should be able to better compare car prices. Cost of electricity vs. gasoline Here’s where EV owners win out. Going electric means you get to skip pricey trips to the pump, which is one of the biggest draws for making the switch. A 2018 study by the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute found that the average cost to fuel an electric car was $485 a year, compared to $1,117 for a gas-powered vehicle. A 2020 Consumer Reports study similarly showed that EV drivers tend to spend about 60 percent less each year on fuel costs compared to drivers of gas-powered cars. And in 2023, the nonpartisan policy firm Energy Innovation released a report showing that these savings benefit drivers across the United States: Every EV model in every state is cheaper to fill than a gas-powered vehicle. These savings are largely based on the fact that current EVs are 2.6 to 4.8 times more efficient at traveling a mile compared to a gasoline internal combustion engine, according to real world data collected by the U.S. Department of Energy.  But these savings calculations aren’t the same for everyone. Here’s where it can get a little complicated. For starters, EVs can vary in efficiency—that is, how far they can go on the same amount of electricity. For an EV, efficiency is measured by how many kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity it consumes per 100 miles—similar to a gas-powered car’s miles-per-gallon stat. (A lower kWh/100 miles rate is better.) The 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6 is a standout in terms of efficiency, with 24 kWh/100 miles, but the more budget-friendly 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EUV is comparable, with a 29 kWh/100 miles rating. So make sure to consider this factor when comparison shopping. Charging your car at home will cause your electricity bill to rise, but by how much will depend on factors like when you charge it and where you live. Electricity costs, like gas prices, can vary significantly by region. Many electric utilities offer lower electricity rates for charging during off-peak hours versus peak, so you'll want to take advantage of this when charging your EV, and many EVs can be programmed to automatically charge during those hours when rates are low. Taking these charging costs into account, a 2020 study broke down the lifetime fuel costs of battery-powered EVs versus internal combustion engine cars state by state. EV owners in Washington State, for example, can save as much as $14,480 over the life of their vehicle—the highest margin in the country. On the other end of the spectrum is Hawaii, where going electric could ultimately cost $2,494 more over 15 years. To get a rough estimate of your own charging costs, multiply an EV’s kilowatt-hour (kWh/100) mileage rate by your electricity rate (measured in cents per kWh), which you can find on your monthly bill. This will give you the electricity costs per 100 miles driven. After figuring in the number of miles you typically drive in a month, you’ll be able to see how much your electric bill may go up. Keep in mind that charging your car overnight, when electricity demand and prices drop, can save you 30 percent on that charge. Also note that public charging stations tend to be more expensive than charging at home. If you rely exclusively on these stations—which do offer faster, higher-voltage charging—your fueling costs could significantly increase. After you figure out how these factors apply to you and your preferred EV model, compare your final electricity cost estimate to what you typically spend on gas.
","
Maintenance costs for electric vs. gas cars Without spark plugs to replace or oil to change, electric vehicles have a clear leg up on maintenance costs. EVs also have the unique feature of “regenerative” braking—recovering the energy normally lost to braking—which saves on brake pad replacements. Electric cars do still require some basic maintenance, of course, like service checks and tire rotations. But in general, electric vehicles typically cost half as much to maintain and repair as gas-powered cars. Lifetime costs for electric vs. gas cars Now, to calculate that all-important number: whether an electric car will be cheaper over the life of the vehicle. You can figure out your savings estimate by calculating the up-front costs of your specific model (minus tax rebates) and then ongoing costs. Those should account for your model’s efficiency, how much you plan to drive, regional electricity costs, charging habits, and maintenance costs per year. Then compare those to the gas-powered alternative. Bottom line: You can bank on saving across the life of your electric vehicle. That’s not too shabby, considering you’ll also be sparing the climate thousands of pounds of carbon pollution over the car’s life, along with other pollutants that create smog, lower local air quality, and cause harm to public health. And of course, carbon pollution carries a price tag of its own (a recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency analysis pegs the social cost of greenhouse gases at $190 per ton), so when we take measures to rein in emissions, there are concrete savings that go well beyond our own pocketbooks too.
