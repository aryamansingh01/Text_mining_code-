"Electric cars are cool but they have some serious deficiencies. 1. They are too expensive, 2. They can't go far enough, 3. They take too long to charge, 4. You can't carry spare fuel. 5. They are no good for towing, 6. If you replace all gasoline cars with electric you will make almost no difference to CO2 emissions, not enough to matter.
They do have lots of torque but if you use it your battery will be drained in a very short time.
On the plus side, they are cool. If I could afford to buy one as a second vehicle, sort of a toy or shopping trolley I'd definitely have one. Overcome the above problems and I'll have one. Until then it's the sweet sweet smell of burning gasoline for me."
7. In a cold climate their efficiency diminishes exponentially.
"I never thought of that,  yes of course."
"The only possible solution for that is solid state batteries,  but that's 4 years away at absolute best"
" >You can't carry spare fuel.

Technically you can. Get a good generator and carry a jerrycan with you."
You could tow a trailer with an entire spare battery in it.
"I have a little insight here owning both a decent electric and gas powered car, while living in scandinavia aka cold area ( [https://imgur.com/a/PtBectY](https://imgur.com/a/PtBectY) ).

Our electric car is actually the cheaper car of the two, yet it came with WAY more equipment than our gas car did. In fact I would have to spit out another €4500 in the gas car to match the equipment in the electric car.

Not only was the electric car the cheaper car to buy, it is also by far the cheaper car to drive. We have a monthly subscription that gives us unlimited charging for €100 a month, including our home charger (and is completely free the first year). For reference, that is only slightly more than a tank of gas in the gas powered car costs, and that only lasts me about a week. So at the bare minimum, our electric car is 4x as cheap to operate for me. I plug it in every day when I come home and always have a full battery. 

I only have to worry about charging times on long trips, and even then I rarely stop for more than 15 minutes at a time. I do multiple 700 km trips every month without being bothered by the distance of the car even the slightest."
"I would have to assume your government heavily subsidises the purchase and operating of your EV? Do they have a road user charge so you are paying your fair share of infrastructure costs? The majority of the cost of petrol where I live is tax and that supports  a whole lot of government expenditure. EV users are dodging this tax as well as using subsidies so the true cost of the vehicle is borne by taxpayers. 
I am glad you enjoy your EV and as I said, I'd love one but they just aren't practical enough yet for my needs. 
I place no value whatsoever on gadgets and gizmos in cars unless they are safety related. I don't care if the car has apple car play."
"We have extremely high car taxes, up to 180% of the original price of the car. This is slightly lower for EV’s, because part of this tax is based on CO2 emissions. We don’t get any bonus or anything like that for buying an EV. EV owners actually pay more road tax anually, because this is based on size and weight of the vehicle, naturally EV’s are heavier. We don’t rely on fuel tax much. 

We have an excessive amount of wind power here, so the electricity market is very competitive. Again no bonus or anything from the government here."
"Sounds like the EVs are a practical vehicle for your situation, good stuff. If they can compete on a relativley level playing field with gas cars and people choose them that's fantastic."
"Yes, people are loving them here! Even our taxis have mostly switched to EV’s. Our busses are currently being upgraded to be electric as well. It’s very interesting with automatic chargers at every major bus stop.

Edit: this is just a cool bonus fact; the chargers for the busses are up to 450kW. This means even a 1-2 minute stop will add upwards of 50km to the range. This happens automatically when the bus has to stop for passengers anyway. https://imgur.com/a/sxafMo0"
"I have always thought mass transit with small electric cars would be good, like uber but driverless. I figured they'd charge them with a return to base style program but you could have auto chargers at crossroads perhaps and they'd maybe only rarely return to base for maintenance."
"1. Yes, but prices are steadily dropping 
2. Yes, but range is increasing, and right now it's enough for most people
3. Not really, 20 minutes on a supercharger gets you a lot of kilometers. 
4. Yeah, that sucks, but most people don't do it anyway.
5. I agree, but we need to wait for batteries on EVs to get bigger. 
6. This is where you are very wrong. Electric cars emit much less co2 than ICEVs because the emissions from making the fuel for IC cars are similar to emissions from making the electricity needed to run an ev, and that's in places with dirty grids, in France or Norway it's a different story. Read this article: https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-electric-vehicles-help-to-tackle-climate-change"
"Yes, but electric cars are far more damaging to build"
"Nope, even accounting for the environmental damage caused building them, they come up ahead of ICE. Remember that some of the biggest environmental disasters were oil spills. And we wouldn't need nearly as much oil if all cars were electric."
I think they're talking about the lithium ion batteries which are very destructive. Gas cars produce more emissions but I don't see how they're more destructive to make and scrap
"Lithium extraction **can** be done cleanly, and even when it's not, you're fucking up a specific, localized area.


With oil extraction you're fucking up the place you extract it, then you have the potential of oil spills and ecological disasters along any point of its transit route to a refinery, then you have the damage of the refining process, as well as the carbon emissions when you burn gasoline or diesel.


Lithium is also highly recyclable, which gasoline and diesel, well... aren't."
I work in shipping and lithium ions are some of the most dangerous goods we transport they're not even allowed on planes
"It's for terrorism, not because of accidental damage, just like knifes, and you don't see 5 gallon jerrycans on planes now do you?"
"No, it's because they can explode."
Well why can't I bring my Jerrycan on the flight with me then?
6. Was more to do with the fact that cars contribute very little to overall CO2 emissions and it's pointless to get rid of them.
"You're half right, energy generation is the MAIN issue, but that's not to undercut the electric vehicle market"
It is early days. People could probably have listed reasons why cars were inferior to horses in their early days. It is only going to get better.
"*Real* car guys prefer steam engines. None of those newfangled ""gas"" or ""electric"" toys for us!"
"Well, la Dee dahh!!! Steam huh, future man?!

I prefer my buggies pulled by two trains of slaves and yaks!"
Ha! You kids and your gimmicks. The pulling of a vehicle with round wheels in order to move forward. I’m a drag man. I just drag my stuff on a sled like device
Sled?!? Why you young whipper snapper! I always hoisted the logs for my cabin on my shoulders!
"I recall back in the day when dragging the blvd, demanding my friends to take turns shoveling coal."
This comment section is why I wish engines that can burn pure water can be invented
*hydrogen*
"So you actually mean you like gas cars more than electric cars, not gas cars are better than electric cars."
It IS r/unpopularOPINION
You understood what i meant
Then why do you scrubs never communicate in your title?
We can't be too surprised I guess. Even people *paid* to write headlines fail most of the time.
"Oh, they succeed... they're just not succeeding at what we'd like them to be."
"I like hamburgers better than hotdogs. Therefore hamburgers are better than hotdogs. See that there? That's called an opinion, like the title of this sub. Maybe work on your understanding of communication before bashing others for theirs. They posted to unpopularOPINION to ....wait for it...post their opinion..."
Replace those meats with races and you'll see how silly your post is.
[removed]
"Car guys are so racesest...Always talking about different races and arguing which one is better. They even had Race Wars in Fast and Furious.....We are such terrible people. And road racing is my favorite type of race and the rest are all inferior. Drag races are way too short. Circle track races...boring when all you do is go fast and turn left. :)

On a more serious note. Thanks for your comment. You had me rolling."
"Opinion- ""a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge.""

So yes, there are people in this world who would have no issue doing what you asked of me, and they would do it with a serious straight face and believe it with all their heart. Which would be their opinion, even it's wrong, it's still an opinion.

Nice try though. Throwing race into arguments only really works when the subject is already about race and you switch the race in the story to see how silly it is, as you put it. I'd choose the word ignorant over silly, but I guess some of us are just better at communicating than others. Ironic huh?"
Now substitute cookies. Go!
"Imo, if he would've meant ""gas cars are more efficient than e-cars"", that would've been an unpopular opinion. I rhink the majority of people think that gas cars are better (when we exclude tha aspect of it the ressources)."

"None of us cant? Am i misreading,misunderstanding, or detecting irony?"
"Right, sounds like ops afraid electric cars are coming for ops hobby."
I mean it’s coal power instead of gas so… they are still equally bad
"But ""I prefer X over Y"" isn't an opinion. It's a factual statement of a personal preference. You can't argue that I don't prefer X over Y.


""X is better than Y"" is an opinion."
"Think of it from this stand point. Fossil fuel has a limited amount on earth that is a fact, not sure how much but it's not if it just when. Our economy runs very very heavily on fossil fuel to run it. So we know we will eventually run out of fossil fuel so why continue to build a society with a pre determined end date on it? 

But honestly ford putting that electric motor in that F100 was pretty freaking cool."
"> Think of it from this stand point. Fossil fuel has a limited amount on earth that is a fact, not sure how much but it's not if it just when. Our economy runs very very heavily on fossil fuel to run it. So we know we will eventually run out of fossil fuel so why continue to build a society with a pre determined end date on it? 

Modern motors are pretty heavily optimized for fossil fuels, so you'd need to tweak them a bit, but there's no reason why combustion motors wouldn't run on stuff like canola oil or grain alcohol, of which we have unlimited supply."
You're still emitting carbon. Those fuels are also waaay less energy efficient to produce than just transitioning to EV's.
"You're emitting exactly the same amount of carbon the plants have been absorbing during their growth. The same amount of carbon would also be released if the plants were eaten and digested, or left to rot on the ground.

I don't think you can apply the notion of ""energy efficiency"" to fuel production. You're producing energy, not using it. ^1 Sure, some of the production steps use energy, but that just deducts from the total production. When you power the harvester with your own grain alcohol, you're still producing more than you use.

Now it's possible that you would produce more energy per acre (i.e. area-efficiency) by just putting up photovoltaic panels instead of planting grain. Maybe. Maybe that would also be cheaper to operate in the long run. But that's beside the point. I never claimed biofuels would be the ""best"" solution in any sense, just that the limited availability of fossil fuels is not *per se* a reason to ditch combustion motors.

^1 In a physical sense, energy cannot be created or destroyed, just transformed. I'm talking about human-usable forms of energy though."
F150 electric is looking good
I'm talking about that 1960s F100 the put their new electric motor in.
Oh
"Electric cars aren’t all spiffy shiny like people think. I hear a lot of “Buy electric and save the environment.”

Keep in mind that most of the car is plastic. This is made of petroleum. The materials for the batteries are made from tons of mining. They’re transported by diesel trucks to dealerships. A lot of the advanced components have the same issues with “dirty” parts of their manufacturing. It’s kind of like how ethanol was added to gas to theoretically improve emissions, but they found that all the emissions released in the manufacturing, processing, and distribution counteracted the benefit of having it in the fuel.

You’re going to have a similar issue when all the parts and instillation of the charging stations and other necessary infrastructure go in. More petroleum will be used for coating cables, whose internal wires will be mined and smelted. Same for the pipes they’re mounted on. All that is gonna be moved and the installed by workers in diesel trucks.

Then there is charging. Lots of that clean electricity comes from coal power plants. Even if you say it doesn’t, the potential fallout from one nuclear meltdown out weighs all the emissions from fossil fuel put together. Even hydro electric has issues from an environmental standpoint. There are rivers now that are removing them to help repair their local ecology. Solar and wind also have issues with dirty manufacturing as well as just not being capable of producing enough power currently.

Then there is the issue that almost all of them try to be proprietary and make components you can only get serviced and repaired at a dealer, F-info with the economy. California is trying to legally force people to go electric. In effect binding them to the mercy of the dealers. Unless they pass legislation forcing manufacturers to allow right to repair, I don’t think it’s feasible.

So while electric is a good step in the right direction and will probably be better eventually, they aren’t the paragon people pretend to be. Those people are just raising the Smug index in their vicinity."
"Plastic isn't being belched into the atmosphere, and is really only a problem once you have to get rid of it, so for durable goods like cars it's less of a huge deal.


Diesel trucks are only a problem until they're replaced with electric trucks.


And even if you're burning coal to charge your EV's, that's an easy fix with a switch to renewables, and even then, 10,000 EV's charged by a coal plant emit less carbon per mile traveled than 10,000 ICE vehicles, because that coal power planet is waaaay more efficient than an internal combustion engine. Economies of scale and all that."
"it's simple: car that makes vroom vroom sound, or car that doesn't kill the planet faster and is also more efficient from a financial aspect"
"I’m a car guy, I prefer gas. I get that electric is the future it’s faster off the line blah blah blah, I don’t care. I’d much rather have a 30 year old Nissan that barely runs over a brand new Tesla Plaid, and if I’m being honest the build quality on that Nissan is still probably better. I’m not against electric, I’m
Against that fact that gas will become a commodity far from the reaches of the mass public which is 90% of car guys."
Thats what im sayin my guy
"As a younger enthusiast, I’m disappointed that I’ll never get to truly experience car culture"
"It's still alive and there are a whole lot of us who will keep those beautiful pieces of history running, even if we have to convert them to alcohol we make in stills in our back yards."
Good car culture is bad

"Happy Easter 

Don’t drive your hummer into a group of children doing a Easter egg hunt"
Why would you chose something that barley runs over something that works
"Call me crazy but where’s the fun in buying something that works but you barely know how. I can fix that Nissan, I can upgrade it and I can make it my own. As far as that Tesla goes I can maybe have a custom paint job."
I get that
"90%? That's a bold assertion, Cotton. Give me performance over *any* 30 year-old Nissan any day. I love me some high-powered screaming internal combustion engines, but nothing beats tearing up a race track with pure performance."
"It could be exaggeration, but you do you. and I’m certain many if not most EV’s struggle around a track so “performance” is pretty one sided. I know that the Plaid’s Nurburgring time is decent but it’s comparable to that of a SUV, made by Lamborghini of course, but still not totally up to pace."
Ford recently released a crate electric motor for car enthusiasts that want to go green. They used it to restore/build a pretty badass F100. I will be buying the E-F150 when it comes out but nothing will replace diesel trucks in my heart or in my garage. Tesla’s are ugly
7.3 powerstroke
A dying breed?  Drive into my work parking lot and that will change your mind.
"I don't think the appeal is to rival some muscular, loud 60s car. Prevailing opinion is that it was all a bit gross really, people want efficiency and calm instead of macho posturing. Yes you may be dying out, sorry."
"You don’t have any testosterone, do you?"
I dont either
"You like metal and gas-powered engines.  So while you may be naturally disinclined toward high testosterone, you are no wallflower."
None of that comes from testosterone
I would argue those using loud noises and cars in an effort to emphasise their masculinity are the ones lacking testosterone tbh.
"You spend all this money on gasoline for only 17-21% of the gas to actually move you down the road. The rest is wasted. The entire purpose of the cooling system is to then remove the roughly 79-83% of the wasted energy from the combustion. 

A gas powered car is like driving an old antiquated stream engine. That what they will feel like in a few years. What a terrible waste of energy."
"I don’t fully agree with your summary, but I fully agree with the sentiment behind it.

I like the idea of never having the hassle of needing to fill up the car because I can just plug in overnight at home.   I also like the mechanical simplicity of the electric car - I don’t ever want to get into a car and realise that, oh shit, this clutch is fucked or this engine is misfiring."
"I'm not sure where you got your numbers, but that sounds like some 70's efficiency. While it isn't great, modern cars are close to double the values you stated for efficiency. Plus the electric you use to charge them mostly comes from fossil fuel power plants. There is also massive amounts of carbon created in the manufacturing of electric cars and batteries. While limiting emissions is great, you have to look at the true carbon cost of electric vehicles. Until we start making fleet vehicles, large trucks, trains, and planes electric as well as have a green power grid to charge them from, consumers buying electric cars does almost nothing to offset carbon and help the environment. I'm not against electric cars at all, it's just that a lot of people try to dump the responsibilities for environmental damage that large industries cause onto the consumer. It's like the corporations who are responsible for 70% of the worlds pollution blaming you for not having LED bulbs or recycling."
"Yeah, engine efficiency has improved drastically, we have materials that minimize heat like aluminum, and we have liquid cooling and exhaust gas recirculation"
Don’t disagree with assessment. Disagree with timeline.
Pretty sure most power is lost in the drivetrain which is 12%
"So your biggest issue with electric cars is the styling? I get it, good old American muscle cars are absolutely beautiful, but in all reality... they're junk. They're poorly built, they're underpowered (power-to-weight ratio is hilarious), they chug gasoline, they're dangerous, and mechanically inferior in every way. Take that sexy-ass 1969 Mach 1 for example. Upwards to 250hp factory - a 2020 Fusion has up to 245hp factory and a much better power-to-weight ratio. The *only* thing that Mustang is good for is looking pretty.

And don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the sound and raw power of an unbridled V8, but as a car enthusiast and automotive professional of 15+ years, performance is where the fun is. Sure, a lot of newer electric cars are vomit-inducing to look at, but then you have beauties like the Rimac and even some of the Tesla models. The Mustang Mach E is only second to the Chevy HHR as ugliest car on the planet, but it is only a *type* of Mustang... not the future of it. 

I think you should dig in to the world of electric cars more before you make a stand - they're incredibly cool, their performance is insane, and the technology is mind-boggling. Also, while you're at it, check out ""Sound of Formula E"" (junk/dead racing series, I know), on YouTube and listen to the poetry."
"I see, that is a good point but the engine doesn’t need to be stock. and also my issue with electric cars isnt as much with their existence as it is with the way people want to replace gas cars with them"
"True, they don't *need* to be stock, but some car enthusiasts would have a fucking stroke if you altered *anything* on a car like that drop-dead gorgeous Mustang. The $200,000 1970 Mach 1 that was at my shop a few weeks ago would be worth a fraction of that if it didn't have matching numbers (and the super sexy Candy Apple Red paint job). 

As for replacing them - I don't see any downsides to it. They perform better, you can take any gas car and convert it to electric, better for the environment, performance (again). Like, I understand the hesitation because big-bad V8's are amazing and get your blood pumping in that specific way (you know what I mean!), but if you look at the details... there are plenty of features on electric cars that will give you a different type of tingle that is on the same level that I, personally, find exciting."
"Yeah ive never been one of those people that are like “omg you threw out that perfectly good stock engine and replaced it with junk” when i see engine swaps. I mean of course i have some opinions that ill openly express but its not my car and why should i care? And i guess it just comes down to different people ant what they like, personally electric cars do nothing for me."
"I was just thinking about this the other day. And Hell yeah it was a blast cruising around in oversized 70s cars. Roomy enough for 6 or more teenagers, and plenty of room for sexy time in the car. Good times!"
"The great thing about EVs is that fuel economy isn't a concern, so they can be as big as automakers want them to be. Like the gargantuan Hummer EV!"
Degenerate
Indeed.
I find quiet and way faster to be cooler.
I find things I don’t need to rely on the dealer to maintain and repair cooler.
Fair but for lots of people its like listening to music when you hear that exhaust note. Plus with electric cars it usually torque that is better
"Mmm nothing like sounds of unnecessary carbon emissions muffling your tunes, delightful"
"You do realize that the electricity that charges your electric vehicle mostly comes from fossil fuel power plants. So until we have a green grid, electric cars are the equivalent of stopping dirty manufacturing in the country by shipping the pollution of industry to less developed countries...

Also, fleet vehicles, planes, etc  are responsible for the majority of emissions so our major focus on electric vehicles should be for commercial ones, not individual ones. Trying to put all problems on to the consumers is no different then the corporations who contribute 70% of the pollution in the world asking people to use LED bulbs and recycle."
"Yeah but that same fuel is utilized one heck of a lot more efficiently. Also, majority of our emissions actually comes from livestock, not engines, therefore nullifying this whole conversation if that's the route you want to go. Small changes on the scale of all consumers makes a big difference, so yes, it's a drop in the bucket I'm the grand scheme of things but it sure is better than doing nothing just because it's not a perfect solution yet."
"I wasn't talking about emissions as a whole, just the ones from the transportation sector. Approximately 25% of total emissions come from the transportation sector. Around 80% of that is from fleet and commercial vehicles. Let the largest polluters be the ones to pay for the infrastructure instead of dumping the bill on tax payers. That's why I believe we need to start from the top down instead of dumping all the responsibility on the consumer. Once industry has a robust infrastructure that supports nationwide distribution of charging technology, then it's easy to get consumers to switch. Corporations should make it easy for consumers to enter the EV market instead of the other way around."
"I mean .. that's already happening. There is a decent number of companies that have developed electric truck companies that are slowly but surely infiltrating the market, all the while developing the infrastructure for charging stations. Not sure where you're from, but all the major highways around me have rows upon rows of charging stations at every rest area, for both personal and fleet vehicles."
"Electric cars green with the grid every time a solar panel gets installed or a ff plant gets shut down the car runs a little greener, gas cars will never be any better for the environment then the day they roll off the lot. Plus even if electric cars are powered from fossil fuel plants, they get more miles out of the fuel. Power plants are way more efficient than cars and that efficiency gets transferred to the car, which can use every drop of power without much waste thanks to regenerative breaking. My car gets 135empg. So for every gallon of gas that’s efficiently converted to electricity, my car can drive 135 miles. 

There is also that you move the burning of the fossil fuels away from populations and reduce air pollution from where people are breathing it, which is a benefit."
" But those things aren't happening yet in most places, so it's still fossil fuels powering them. That fuel is still transported by diesel trucks, trains, and ships that eat fuel at thousands of tonnes a day. This is one of the two issues I have with pushing consumers to go green while they just hide the pollution so you don't see it. People driving cars is a small fraction of vehicle emissions in the world. Commercial vehicles are responsible for the majority. This needs to be a top down conversion, not bottom up. Fleet vehicles need to be first. Then you have someone to help pay for the infrastructure. I don't agree with tax payers footing the entire bill when the multinational corporations are responsible for 70% of the worlds emissions. I'm tired of them fucking up the world and then trying to guilt you and me into believing it's our fault. I have solar panels on my roof, and heat pump hot water heater, led bulbs in everything, and keep the AC on 80 and heat on 68. I do all that and it doesn't change shit in the world. If the airline and shipping industry did their part, air quality would be dramatically changed in months. I mean look how quick the air cleared up when the world locked down last year. The earth can heal itself pretty quickly when we give it a chance.

As to your second point, moving pollution from one place to another does not get rid of it. The earth is a gigantic singular ecosystem. Moving emissions from one place to another is like taking the trash out of your trash can and putting it in a closet. You're still trashing your house, even if you can't see it. 

I'm all for electric cars, but I will still keep something with an internal combustion engine, even if it has to be some hybrid fuel. I don't want to destroy old cars and their history. But I also understand that it is exactly that, history. I look forward to the future of EV's."
Which is exactly why I'm waiting to get mine until I can get solar panels and a power cell installed at the same time.
And in the meantime you’re on foot?

Having fun on your high horse
Wait you try listening to music over a exhaust that you have to be loud and put you on a hitlist
What? No the exhaust note is like music to our ears.
Yay I love pollution
Well has cars were popularized because it was more efficient than electric
For me its the way its all put together and how it functions and how good it looks doing it too
What I mean was the first car was electric. The. The gas car was made and developed back then because it was more efficient and greener than the electric one.
This isn't really accurate. Electric motors haven't changed much since then and were way more efficient than even today's gas engines. The problem back then is the same one we still have today. Battery tech. It also had a lot to do with big oil lobbying and throwing tons of money around to make gas cars appear better. The first electric cars were built around the time that Standard oil was king and they were not about to have oil devalued.
"Electric cars have had way less development money pit in them, once the industry is huge, there will be even better electric supercars."

electric kit cars. better learn to use a soldering iron.
This opinion isn’t even vaguely unpopular in the car community.
In the car community yes but in the world no its very popular
Develope an interest as large into the electric motor as you have in the gas motor.
Cant wait for studies regarding the carbon footprint in producing these new batteries and disposing of the batteries for the electric cars.
I can't wait either
"""saving the earth"" just do a little look into what lithium mines do, and how bad the batteries actually are. Also, in the cold climates what happens if the battery dies? Imagine all the cars that might get stuck in a blizzard? How will they all be jumped? It's take days. Lots of disadvantages that people don't stop and think about because they're so eager to be accepted into the band-wagon"
And there are also a lot of advantages that people like you don't think about
"No I think about it, just don't think it's worth changing my vehicle for."
"You don't have to change vehicle, you could just wait for your current one to die, or get an electric to pair with your current car, because the cost savings are immense"
"I'd like to in fact, I'm just saying it's not ALL good"
Not when it comes time to change the battery.
"You act like it's some massive deal breaker,  it takes over 400k miles to get it to 90% of its original capacity, and by that point anyone would have sold it to get a new car"
"In candor, I had no idea technology had reached such duration/charge cycle lengths."
">This could be the death of car enthusiasts if electric cars eventually take over and gas cars maybe outlawed.

Contining the consume fossil fuels at our current, or even much lower, rate means the death of everyone so it's a fair swap."
You know it takes more energy to import /make electric cars.
"When I was born my father had a 1968 Chevy C-10. A truck he really loved. Ultimately he had to sell it for a cheaper vehicle to support the family.

When I was 14 my father bought an old, beat up, disused 68 Chevy C-10. For the next 2 years me and my dad rebuilt it together.

When I was 21, and was heading to a new place for work after spending some time overseas my dad handed me the keys to the truck and told me to take good care of it. I was kind of shocked. He had finally got his truck again and was going to just give it to me after a few years? Once I got past the hard part of the training I was at, my family told me that he had been diagnosed with brain cancer, and that they didn't want me to worry about that while getting ready to take an important test.

When I was 24 I was going through a rough time financially, and keeping up with the truck was getting expensive. Ultimately I realized I had to sell the truck, and I felt like an absolute failure. My wife just smiled at me and said ""Your dad would be so proud to see you doing what you need to do to take care of your family""

&#x200B;

I get that you love the internal combustion engine, there's nothing wrong with that, your interest in them is totally valid.

&#x200B;

We need to get rid of them to take care of the species."
Electric cars are terrible for the environment too.
But oil is a limited supply
You need oil to get the lithium for the batteries. A lot of resources are needed to make the batteries and then the batteries are terrible for the environment when they are decaying after use.
Lithium ion are recyclable and can be destroyed if no longer has its use. The body of the battery are usually recycled.
"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0147651308000742

They’re not perfect. People assume electric vehicles are great for the environment and neglect all of the oil and resources needed to make the battery and the waste when batteries are done. I was mistaken in some of it - I thought i remembered reading how the batteries ruin the soil and take forever to decompose (I guess that applies more to the acidic batteries)"
Guess what ? Electric cars seem mainly plastic. What is plastic? Petrochemical. Also lithium mining is more damaging than any combustion cars entire lifespan
"> Also lithium mining is more damaging than any combustion cars entire lifespan

That isn't even remotely true, given that lithium mining [accounts for less than 2.3% of an EV's overall impact](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es903729a), and the majority of any car's environmental impact happens in operations, which is where EVs have a massive lead."
Offshore drilling is WAY more damaging especially to the marine envoronment and the animals living in it.
It really sounds like you haven't driven one to me.
"Yeah man, I love wasting 80% of my energy for some engine notes. Fuck yeah! Fuck the environment too. I want my burbles and roars! Let's have a miniature explosion near my crotch! That sounds fun too! No one will call me a pillock for making lots of noise. Let's put that prat hat on and go full throttle. /s

I right now am considering ditching the old Lotus because it's not as quick as an electric either, and I can always copy my Prime Minister if I need some engine sounds."
"Ive driven both and its just not the same. I like the roar of the engine in a gas car. Sure a tesla 0-60 kills any six figure car but the driving experience feel and engine sound is more important, and it just cant be accomplished in electric. 

This is why some people continue to drive stick shifts. They want to be a part of the experience. A tablet and a steering wheel just was too fuckin bland.

Filling up your car in 1 minute also is a major convenience, as opposed to waiting hours and hours for your car to charge. The infrastructure in my country will take forever to build and most likely will be overcrowded if everyone was to switch to electric cars overnight. 

Oil and gas makes people and its workers rich. It builds nations wealth funds. Lithium is mined by 6 year olds under harsh conditions for pennies."
"Agreed, they're not the same. But whether that's worse or better seems to be a matter of perspective. You don't need to be deafened by an engine to enjoy the driving experience.

I too was a manual-only (""stick shift"") driver, because I generally hated when auto transmissions decided to change gears. EVs don't have gear changes, so losing the stick didn't worry me. (This technically doesn't apply to all EVs, but it does to mine).

As for filling your car up in 1 minute (seems optimistic, but whatever) - how about never having to do it at all? That's the best way to own an EV: charge at home when you're not using it. No driving to the station, no queues, no waiting. And a fraction of the cost.

Oil and gas do make *some* people rich - but at the expense of literally everyone else. That probably includes you."
"Another issue with EV - charging at home. EV advocates assume everyone has the infrastructure set in place to charge these cars (a private garage).

Picture someone living in an apartment or a housing block with streetside parking. They cannot charge their cars without inconvenience. Some new apartments do have chargers in place, but very limited. And if its taken, you can forget about charging your car for the day and have to call your friend with the ICE.

Oil and gas producing countries have done wonders for their people by distributing the revenues. UAE has the largest sovereign fund in the world for its citizens. Qatar, Saudi Arabaia, Norway all have distributed that wealth. I can guarantee it wont be the same for lithium."
"What happens when I want to drive somewhere that is six times the range of the car's battery? How does one drive cross country or take a long road trip that covers thousands of miles at this point? I think electric cars are great for urban areas and commuting, but they still have things that hold them back in some scenarios."
Nobody comes to a worksite with only hammers...
I'm not against electric cars at all. I think they are cool and the power potential of all that glorious torque makes my right foot tingle. I just think we need to tackle electric differently than we are. I've explained why elsewhere in this post if you want to read. It was kind of a long explanation and for some reason trying to copy/paste things at the moment keeps glitching.
"I'll try and find that later, I'll be interested to see if there is anything I haven't considered.

I will say that most power distribution concerns I do know of are chicken and egg situations, particularly in countries cursed with private infrastructure. In that scenario, ploughing ahead with EVs is required to instigate the upgrades needed, at least in my opinion."
"TLDR of my other comment. Start from the top with fleets and commercial vehicles so that the corporations and industry that due the most damage to the environment are the ones who have to invest in the infrastructure instead of dumping it on tax payers and consumers to clean up their mess. Highways will never be electrified entirely, to where you charge while you drive, until tractor trailers are electric. They won't spend that money for a few people with Teslas. Once the infrastructure becomes more readily available, then you push the public to convert. Beyond the infrastructure, some of those large companies also have alot more money for R&D than auto manufacturers, which would help the tech advance for more efficiency, better batteries, etc. Corporations are great at squeezing out every last penny for efficiency and cost, so let's use it to our advantage for a change."
Works for me.
What is important about engine sound
Electric motors are vastly superior to combustion engines. There's no comparison.
"Not really, a lot of gasoline engines can still do more than a electric, electric is limited by batteries. Also I'm pretty sure voltage is a factor too. 

Also gas turbines will always be better."
"Yes a gas engine is more versatile in terms of modern infrastructure. This wouldn't be a conversation if lithium batteries were as prolific as petroleum products. 

But strictly from an engineering standpoint, if you put a gasoline engine up against an electric motor, the electric motor would out perform it by orders of magnitude. Torque, horse power, longitivity and maintenance are all way in the favor of electric."
"Looking at gas cars and electric cars, gas cars seem to be more powerful, Longevity not counting batteries is longer though"
Are you drunk? How are gas cars more powerful? 2 of the 3 fastest (street legal) cars are electric.
"The 7.3L v8 godzilla, it can put out over 1000 hp with turbo"
How much does it weigh might I ask?
"540 lbs, without turbos, with turbos is probably 580

It's cast iron which makes it efficient with heat and very durable but it's really heavy, it's using pushrods instead of hydraulic lifters which takes off a few lbs"
Still more than the electric ones
"Yes, but it also puts out similar power and once you add the weight if the batteries and multiple electric motors, it will outweigh the engine"
"https://www.thedrive.com/news/38149/fords-7-3l-godzilla-v8-can-make-1100-hp-with-twin-turbos-and-little-else

Pretty sure that's more powerful than the electric hummer, electric cybertruck,  and the electric f150"
"1050 lbs-ft of torque and 1020 hp, but another motor could make it up to 1360 hp and 1400 torque and the motors weigh less too."
"Are you talking about additional electric motors? Currently a single gas/diesel engine is more powerful than electricity motors because most electric cars have 2 or more motors and put put similar power to one gas engine.

Diesel can blow electric away, a dyno 7.3 powerstroke can have 400hp and 1000ft lbs.

https://youtu.be/aK7vS-HHFo4

It's a 20+ year old design"
"Nobody's makes electric motors that big because there isn't a need, sure a single large electric motor is more powerful than a small one, but the drive shaft and differentials take space, are heavy, and expensive. Plus if you can produce the smaller ones at a larger scale and just change how many you need per car then that can keep costs lower"
When those muscle cars were hitting the market you were the guy crying about how you miss the smell of literal horse shit
No i actually wasnt born yet
"It’s a “would have been”type  comment, I figured you’re probably not 120 years old.  Hate to explain the joke but has to do with you being hung up on nostalgia"
Lol nah i just like cars. Not horse shit
Well hypothetically if you were Alive when cars were just coming out do you think you would like horse shit
Nah i dont think so. Horse shit smells bad
"Laughs in EV. Yeah, i pay $1200 to charge my car and have zero maintenance. Enjoy your gas guzzler."
Until you replace the battery.
"Chevrolet is paying for my $11,000 battery upgrade. I'm hyped on electric cars and will never go back."
"Warranty claim due to failure?   I can’t imagine they are giving out batteries otherwise.  As for me, until electric trucks can pull a trailer 600 miles a day without substantial stopping, or readily be recharged in rural environments, I’ll decline."
Massive battery recall.  Lifestyle was definitely a deciding factor in the purchase.
Why would you ever replace the battery?
This is a boomer opinion
Whelp this is an unpopular opinion! Thats why i posted here. Have a good day
Not unpopular. A boomer opinion
It's not generational. It's just car people. It's why we save cars of all ages. There are people from teens to boomers who love cars and would agree with the OP.
Now that's a boomer opinion
Im a teenager btw
"My parents are boomers and they weren't super young when they had me, so again, you are off the mark on this one."
why do you care about the sound of a car like whats so appealing
Its hard to explain because im bad with words but its literally music to our ears. It makes us smile and every car is unique.
"My 5.4 triton v8 sound great, at idle it makes this deep burr that you can feel, sort of like a subwoofer with this whistle noise from the fan, and when accelerating it sounds like a race car, and when you get to the higher gears it makes this deep almost diesel like noise with a howl when you accelerate in the higher gear, and than in overdrive it makes a really deep almost diesel like noise minus the howl.

That engine sounds great"
Why
Because it does
The ability for electric cars to save the earth is questionable. What they are is virtue signals for rich people.
"If you make claims then you need to show evidence,  now was that a claim you made?"
"I don't have to do anything, you pompous ass. I made a comment on a bullshit internet forum. Take it or leave it.

e: if you do want claims, read the many thorough comments above."
"Damn bro, you didn't have to get all emotional about it"
Lol

"there is a lot of work to artificially reproduce those engine and exhaust sounds. i have a 67 Chevy Impala in the barn, and an old GMC truck. i can recognize those vehicles coming down the road by sound alone. i get it.

but as an engineer i also appreciate efficiency. there is far more energy density is fuel than a battery given current technology, but we are just at the beginning of what's possible. the engine is s beautiful piece of tech, but it's time to move on to something better.

IC engine companies have been focusing on bigger and more powerful thanks to relatively cheap fuel and car culture when they should have been focusing on efficiency and emissions. this has been a long time coming."
"A: I agree 100%, but more from a logical standpoint. Don't get me wrong, my favorite car is a 1963 Plymouth Belvedere 440, but i just can't see electric cars being more sustainable than gas.

B: I love your username. Which band is your favorite?"
Now if your an elitist you might call me a poser but i really enjoy slipknot
"Hey, that's your favorite band, your taste, i ain't knocking it. Hell, i grew up listening to Slayer, not by choice, and still not by choice, but it's what i was around. I can't really say i'm elitist because i listen to Grunge, which isn't really known to be technically proficient."
Hell yeah! I was just worried because alot of people on here who like metal are very much elitists lol. Cant say i listen to slayer a whole bunch but im always down to try new bands
"I love cars too, but electric gives you that instant torque 💯 maybe not an exciting rev but it's worth it"
"Try hydrogen powered cars then. They're gonna move.. And be green if you don't use methane to get your hydrogen...

"I have nothing against electric cars per se. My biggest gripe is the fact that all of them resemble any other modern car. Big touchscreens and infotainment system. Mediocre storage space. Beeping noises for every fucking thing. Hard, if not impossible to fix yourself. Too much useless electronics. Often impractical. Expensive. On top of that, most of them are just hideous. 

Gas cars are better than electric cars solely because the proper cars of the 20th century are gasoline powered. I can fit three bicycles at the back of my Saab 900. Panels are not one foot thick. There's a spare tire. I want to be able to tow and also to fold my backseat. You can fit so much inside such a small car. 

All I want is a car like that, but electric. And without any touchscreens."
It saddens me that you think staying primitive should be the future.
we should just get rid of cars so that no one would argue about which is better
"It’s really about haves and have nots. The whole discussion was over when the 3 came out.  You’ll never own a model s that wraps you in luxery, and I’ll never sit in a Ford Escape or Land Rover, or pump gas or sit in Walmart on my phone with risky coffee waiting on an oil change.

Each of us will feel we are doing it right, and that is ok because that’s our call."
If the only thing better better about gas cars is the sound then you might want to rethink your stance
"I like gas cars more too, electric cars are boring."
">New cars never really exited me and some electric cars kind of gross me out.

Grammatical error on excited"
Ok sorry for not being a fucking robot bitch
"Electric cars dont save the planet. Aluminium for frame, lithium for accumulators, a lot of cheap dirty power... It sounds like something good, yeah, but if you'll think deeper, you'll understand, that there's nothing new for planet"
"electric cars won’t kill car culture, the current electric car market sucks because every electric car is an obese overweight luxury crossover or large sedan with a weird design and there isn’t any cars targeted toward the average car enthusiast but as electric cars become more popular there will eventually be interesting, lightweight, cheap, tuner friendly electric cars"
"It's very apparent that you have never driven a proper electric car. They make gas powered cars feel ancient. What exactly is it you think is so bad about them?

I've been a car enthusiast my whole life, and now owning both an electric and a gas car, I must say gas cars are old news. Electric cars are faster, more responsive and are generally nicer to operate on a daily basis.

Not to mention they are much cheaper to drive, at least in countries with electric subscriptions like here."
